Climatology, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with the natural and man-made forces that influence long-term weather patterns. Climatologists are scientists who specialise in this field. Climate scientists have recently concentrated their efforts on the changes in the Earth's climate that have happened since the industrial revolution. As human activity has expanded and emitted more carbon into the atmosphere, the Earth has become warmer. Climate scientists are particularly interested in this impact, which is known as global warming.

The ability to think creatively is the first stage; communicating good ideas to coworkers requires sensitivity. For modelling, simulating, and evaluating complicated mechanical, electrical, or other engineering systems, many mechatronic engineers employ computer-aided design (CAD) and other engineering tools.",

      "summary": "Molecular Biology is a multi-disciplinary field which studies and analyses the molecular basis of biological activity. Molecular biologists carry out research and experiments on nucleic acid such as DNA and RNA and proteins, lipids and carbohydrates to understand the complex interaction of these molecules and how they contribute to life processes. Their work is related to DNA sequencing, cloning, RNA functioning, and studying other cellular behavior in humans, plants, animals and other organisms. They attempt to find specific patterns in some biological materials and replicate the findings of their research in other experiments to frame hypotheses or theories. The understanding of molecular function can then be applied to other fields such as pharmaceutical, agriculture, wildlife, medicine, food industry and other industrial fields.",

The main aim of this field is safety, stability, and security i.e. to ensure that these structures can withstand the pressure and stresses from various environmental factors. These professionals must safeguard buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure. Structural engineers work in teams of civil engineers, architects, contractors and construction workers to provide technical advice. This field requires the person to have in-depth knowledge about physics, mathematics, and the properties of the various materials used to construct the infrastructures. They must be able to calculate how varied materials function under the stress of different environmental conditions like pressure, temperature, corrosive liquids and gases, and also radiation. These professional also require strong computer skills as they are reuired to build models using computer-aided design technology. Skills like creativity, team working, communication, mathematical, analytical, IT, and attention to detail are important in this profession.
